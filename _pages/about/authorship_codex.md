# üõ°Ô∏è Authorship Codex ‚Äî Pavlo Protsenko  
_Originator of the Positioning System_  
_A discipline of posture-based living, forged under pressure._

---

## I. Author, Not Adopter

This is not a repackaged trend.  
Not a remix of self-help material.  
Not an assembly of quotes and productivity hacks.

**Positioning** is a lived framework ‚Äî  
Built over 20 years through:

- Military command  
- Mental health collapse and return  
- Priesthood and fatherhood  
- Masculine brotherhood and estrangement  
- Legal study, leadership, and structural clarity  

I did not find this system.  
I forged it ‚Äî with scars.

---

## II. Demonstrator, Not Guru

I do not claim perfection.  
But I live the rhythm.

I did not wait until I felt ready to lead.  
I chose posture first ‚Äî and let clarity follow.

This system is not authored from above.  
It is authored *from within* ‚Äî and *under weight.*

## III. Invitation Without Dilution

You may walk this path.  
You may contribute tools.  
You may translate this into your language, your home, your practice.

But the source stands.

Respect the rhythm.  
Hold the structure.  
And know who carried the weight to build it.

---

## IV. Codex Clause

The Positioning Framework is authored by Pavlo Protsenko.  
This includes its:

- Tenets and values  
- GPT seeds and tone architecture  
- Symbolic modules (fatherhood, power, calm, etc.)  
- Language system and authorship rhythm  
- Website structure and public declarations

You may **use, adapt, and build** ‚Äî but with **attribution and clarity.**  
This is not brand. It is *legacy logic.*

## V. Signature

**Pavlo Protsenko**  
Founder, Demonstrator, and Author of Positioning  
For those who choose posture over noise.  
For men building rhythm under pressure.  
For clarity that trains others silently.
