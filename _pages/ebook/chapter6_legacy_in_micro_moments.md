# 📖 Chapter 6 — Legacy Begins in Micro-Moments  
_Your child becomes what your patterns normalize._

---

## 1. Symbolic Fragment

> I didn’t know he was watching.  
> I closed the cupboard gently. I breathed instead of sighing.  
> The next morning, I heard him do the same thing.  
> Not because I taught it —  
> But because I modeled it.

---

## 2. Core Teaching

You don’t get to choose which moment becomes memory.  
Legacy is not delivered. It is *picked up* — silently.

Your child is not memorizing your values.  
He is inheriting your **nervous system under pressure.**

Positioning trains the father to treat every moment as signal.  
Because it’s not what you explain — it’s *what you consistently repeat without knowing.*

---

## 3. Applied Discipline

- Before correcting a child, check your posture.  
- Clean one thing calmly every day, without asking for credit.  
- Exit the room with clarity — not commentary.  
- Pause before answering repeated questions — and respond with rhythm, not reaction.

---

## 4. Legacy Question

> What did your child silently inherit from your rhythm today?

---

Legacy is built like water carves stone —  
**One quiet moment at a time.**
