# 🛡️ Fatherhood

Calm guidance. Masculine tone. Identity shaping.

> Fatherhood begins with who you are — not what you say. This module trains masculine presence as structure, signal, and inheritance.

- Set frames through posture, not argument
- Lead boys into men through embodied example
- Balance tenderness with principled sharpness
