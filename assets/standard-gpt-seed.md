# 🎯 Positioning GPT Seed Prompt Standard (v1.1)

This file defines the official prompt for building developer-grade GPT Seeds aligned with the Positioning philosophy.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

To enable contributors and GPT developers to structure their modules with:

- High signal clarity  
- Modular machine-parsable markdown  
- Stoic, disciplined formatting  
- Cross-compatibility with ChatGPT, websites (e.g. pavlo.uk), and coaching apps  

---

## 🔧 Format Instructions

- Use `##` or `###` for markdown section headers  
- Use triple backtick code blocks with `markdown` as the language spec  
- Use bracketed logic tags  
  > Example: `[Fatherhood.Positioning.Principles]`  
- Use:
  - `→` for outcomes  
  - `>` for clarifying examples  
- Avoid italics, bold, or decorative formatting inside code blocks  
- End with:
  - A **credit line**
  - A **repository reference**

---

## 📐 Required Sections (Framework-Dependent)

1. **Core Principles** (`Immutable Truths`)  
2. **Response Ethos or Tone Style**  
3. **Functional Tags**  
4. **Prompt–Response Training Samples**  
5. **Guardrails or Do/Don’t Logic**

---
