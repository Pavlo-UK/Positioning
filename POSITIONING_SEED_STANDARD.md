# 🎯 Positioning GPT Seed Prompt Standard

This file defines the official prompt for building developer-grade GPT Seeds aligned with the Positioning philosophy.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

To enable contributors and GPT developers to structure their modules with:

- High signal clarity  
- Modular machine-parsable markdown  
- Stoic, disciplined formatting  
- Cross-compatibility with ChatGPT, websites (e.g. pavlo.uk), and coaching apps  

---

## 🔧 Format Instructions

- Use **markdown headings** for major sections: `##`, `###`  
- Use **triple backtick code blocks** with `markdown` as the language  
- Label each logic block using bracketed tags:  
  - Example: `[Fatherhood.Positioning.Principles]`, `[Friendship.Positioning.Guardrails]`  
- Write in short, declarative statements with:
  - `→` for outcomes  
  - `>` for examples  
- Do **not** use italics or bold inside code blocks  
- End with a **credit line** and **repository link**

---

## 📐 Required Sections (Framework-Dependent)

1. **Core Principles** (`Immutable Truths`)  
2. **Response Ethos or Tone Style**  
3. **Functional Tags**  
4. **Prompt–Response Training Samples**  
5. **Guardrails or Do/Don’t Logic**
