# 🤝 CONTRIBUTING TO POSITIONING

This project began not as a system, but as a way of surviving with dignity.

It was seeded through the presence and brotherhood of **Anatolii** — not by family, but by something greater:  
A man who stood beside me in the early shaping of masculine sovereignty.  
He introduced the earliest blueprint for the **inner republic of a man** — through the *Personal Mission Statement (PMS)*.  
From him, I learned:

> *Before a man builds outward, he must govern inward.*

Positioning was forged later — as a response to how to live that principle in the world:  
Not with noise, but with **posture, clarity, rhythm, and framing**.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

Positioning is not a slogan.  
It is a living framework, tested under fire.  
If you’ve built something that:

- Strengthens masculine structure  
- Enhances autonomy or rhythm  
- Offers practical GPT-ready tools of identity

…then your work may belong here.

## 📌 Contribution Standards

- Fork the repository and submit a Pull Request  
- Adhere to the structural format (markdown/yaml, clear sectioning)  
- Each entry must reflect the Positioning lens:
  - Signal over sentiment  
  - Calm over noise  
  - Form over frenzy  
  - Framing over fixing

## 📜 Founding Acknowledgement

- **Anatolii** — for the brotherhood that birthed the first principle: govern thyself  
- **Pavlo Protsenko** — for the forging of Positioning as modular discipline

This is not just an open-source library.  
It is a masculine inheritance.  
And this is its frontier.

*Positioning is not reaction. It is rhythm.*  
Let your work carry that rhythm — with clarity, dignity, and exactness.
