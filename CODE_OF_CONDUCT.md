## üìñ Purpose

This project exists to advance Positioning as a lifestyle of structured sovereignty, long-arc masculinity, and internal discipline.

It is a doctrinal space ‚Äî not a debate forum.  
Participation here requires posture, not noise.

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Conduct

All contributors and participants agree to:

- Operate with calm, clarity, and self-governed tone.  
- Contribute with structural thought ‚Äî not reactive emotion.  
- Respect the integrity of the Positioning framework.  
- Offer critique only when anchored in principle, not ego.  
- Honour the long-game of legacy, not short-term applause.

---

## ‚ùå Unacceptable Conduct

The following will result in removal or banning:

- Disrespectful, dismissive, or emotionally unregulated responses  
- Attempts to reframe Positioning into therapeutic or ideological movements  
- Injection of identity politics, religious proselytising, or commercial promotion  
- Undermining the posture, tone, or sovereignty of the repository  
- Any attack ‚Äî direct or subtle ‚Äî against contributors or the author

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Enforcement

This project is curated, not crowdsourced.

Violation of this code may result in:

- Immediate content deletion  
- Revocation of contribution privileges  
- Formal ban from project participation

Enforcement decisions will be made with **calm authority and finality.** No public arbitration.

---

## ü§ù Respect & Alignment

You are not required to agree with Positioning to learn from it.  
You are required to **hold form** if you engage.

If you align with its tone, logic, and discipline ‚Äî welcome.  
If not, this space is not for you. That is not rejection. It is clarity.

---

**Positioning is not just a philosophy ‚Äî it is a posture.**  
This repository exists to preserve that posture, for men seeking a higher frame of life.
